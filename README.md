Comparing model scores of different machine learning regression models on housing price dataset.
Importing the csv file of the raw housing data.
Cleaned the data and check the correlations between all features.
Split the dataset into train and test data.
Fit the train data into the following regression models:-
Linear Regression,Lasso Regression,Ridge Regression,
RandomForest Regression,AdaBoost Regression,Bagging Regression,
ExtraTrees Regression,KNeighbours Regression,DescisionTree Regression.
Ploting the graph of score of different models for comparision for better fit.
